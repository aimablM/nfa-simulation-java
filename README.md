# NFA-Simulation-Java
ðŸ§  Diagram Info:
The NFA has:

States: q1, q2, q3

Start State: q1

Accepting State: q2

Transitions:

q1 â†’ q2 on 0 or 1

q1 â†’ q3 on Îµ (epsilon)

q3 â†’ q1 on Îµ (epsilon)

q3 â†’ q2 on 0

(There is a cycle between q1 and q3 through Îµ-transitions.)

ðŸ§  Now matching to numbers:
Letâ€™s label:

q1 â†’ 1

q2 â†’ 2

q3 â†’ 3

3 0 2

Line	Meaning
3	Number of states (1, 2, 3)
2	Accepting state is 2
1 0 2	From state 1 on input 0, go to state 2
1 1 2	From state 1 on input 1, go to state 2
1 -1 3	From state 1 via Îµ-move, go to 3
3 -1 1	From state 3 via Îµ-move, go to 1
3 0 2	From state 3 on input 0, go to 2
ðŸ—‚ Instructions
âœ… Create a plain text file called nfa.txt.
âœ… Copy-paste the above 6 lines exactly.
âœ… Save it in the same folder as your NFASimulator.java.

ðŸ§ª Test cases from assignment:

Input string	Expected Output
0	ACCEPT
01	ACCEPT
110	ACCEPT
0100	ACCEPT
100	REJECT
(You will see why when we explain the Îµ-cycles.)

ðŸš€ QUICK NEXT STEPS CHECKLIST:
 Save the nfa.txt above.

 Compile and run your program.

 Enter nfa.txt when asked.

 Test with 0, 01, 110, 0100, and 100.
